## Project Introducion

Welcome to my data science portfolio showcasing my House Prices Kaggle competition project. In this project, I aimed to predict house prices based on various features provided in the dataset. Let's dive into the details and see how I approached this challenging problem


## Problem Statement

The task at hand was to develop a regression model that accurately predicts house prices. The ability to estimate house prices based on relevant features is crucial in the real estate industry, aiding in decision-making for buyers, sellers, and investors.

The main difficulty is :

- Feature engineering is important and difficult in the project due to the 80+ features.
- Regression method choose is essential due to the high dimension data.

## Data Understanding

The dataset provided comprehensive information about houses, including features like square footage, number of rooms, location, and more. After thoroughly examining the dataset, I identified 79 features that could potentially impact house prices. I also noticed some missing values and outliers, which required careful handling during preprocessing.

## Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

There are several kinds of data preprocessing methods:
